# Dream Team Episode 3: Revenge of the Teach for Belgium

## Setup
We don't have any Node packages but once we do next week, you can build and run the code like this. 


```
npm install
node index.js
```


If you have some MIDI data or MusicXML files and want to make some NoteSequences to feed Magenta, edit the directory lines in test.py and run the file. (WIP)


## TechnologieÃ«n in gebruik
### Electronica: 
- Arduino 
- [Johnny Five](http://johnny-five.io/)
- [Phillips Hue Node API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-hue-api)

### AI:          
- [Magenta (PerformanceRNN, ImprovRNN)](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/)
- Markov chain (progressions)

### Back-end:    
- Node.js
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
- Some MIDI library we still need to look for. (Magenta also has capabilities, maybe WebMIDI API)
